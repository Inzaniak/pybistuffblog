Hello World!
Today we are going to connect Power Bi to a SQLite database using Python.
There are usually 2 ways to connect: <br>• ODBC <br>• Python

ODBC requires you to setup the ODBC drivers for sqlite, which you can find <a href="http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/">here</a>.

Doing this in Python is pretty easy, becaus Python has a standard library to read and edit SQLite databases.

Let's start coding:
çSQLite Connection
§import sqlite3
§import pandas as pd
§conn = sqlite3.connect("PATH TO YOUR DB")
§df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * from TABLE", conn)
Now we have a connection to the table that we can edit by using Power Query.

That's all for today.
