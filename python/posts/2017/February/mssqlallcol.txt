When developing a database, it can be useful to be aware of column names on tables, in case one wants to check for aliasing errors or search for a specific column.

To retrieve them, you just need to read from some system views.
<ul>
	<li>sys.columns: Contains the list of columns contained within the DB.</li>
	<li>sys.tables: Contains the list of tables contained within the DB.</li>
	<li>sys.schemas: Contains a list of the schemas contained within the DB.</li>
	<li>sys.types: Contains the list of data types contained within the DB.</li>
	<li>sys.views: Contains the list of views contained within the DB.</li>
</ul>

Launching one of these two scripts you will get the list of tables or views with their schemas and their columns with data types

Version with tables:
§tsql
§select   s.name   as [Schema]
§  ,t.name   as [Table]
§  ,c.name   as [Column]
§  ,tp.name  as [Type]
§  ,c.max_length as [Length]
§from sys.columns c
§join sys.tables t
§on c.object_id = t.object_id
§join sys.schemas s
§on s.schema_id = t.schema_id
§join sys.types tp
§on c.system_type_id = tp.system_type_id
 

Version with Views:
§tsql
§select   s.name   as [Schema]
§  ,v.name   as [View]
§  ,c.name   as [Column]
§  ,tp.name  as [Type]
§  ,c.max_length as [Length]
§from sys.columns c
§join sys.views v
§on c.object_id = v.object_id
§join sys.schemas s
§on s.schema_id = v.schema_id
§join sys.types tp
§on c.system_type_id = tp.system_type_id
