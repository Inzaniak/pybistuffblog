Today i want to share a simple snippet of code which I find useful from time to time. With this code you can check if a query is running on your db in a quick and effective way.

çtsql
çSELECT 
ç    sqltext.TEXT, 
ç    req.session_id, 
ç    req.status, 
ç    req.command, 
ç    req.cpu_time, 
ç    req.total_elapsed_time 
çFROM sys.dm_exec_requests req 
ç    CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(sql_handle) AS sqltext
That's it, have a nice day :)
