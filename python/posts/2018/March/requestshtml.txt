When i first discovered that the creators of the popular HTTP library for python were working on a library to manage HTML pages i was excited!
Requests is probably one of the libraries i use the most. It handles HTTP requests in an easy and "human-readable" way.
But the problem with requests was that you had to use another library to manage the html response of the website, but not anymore!
çThe Basics
Using this library it's pretty simple and straightforward. First of all we start as usual with pip:
§general
§pip install requests-html

Then we make a GET request like this:
§python
§from requests_html import HTMLSession
§session = HTMLSession()
§
§r = session.get('https://python.org/')

Now that the page is loaded we can search for html tags using JQuery tags:
§python
§about = r.html.find('#about', first=True)

Then we can look at that element attributes or content:
§python
§print(about.text)
§# About
§about.attrs
§# {'id': 'about', 'class': ('tier-1', 'element-1'), 'aria-haspopup': 'true'}
§about.html
§# '<li aria-haspopup="true" class="tier-1 element-1 " id="about">\n<a class="" href="/about/" title="">About</a>\n<ul aria-hidden="true" class="subnav menu" role="menu">\n<li class="tier-2 element-1" role="treeitem"><a href="/about/apps/" title="">Applications</a></li>\n<li class="tier-2 element-2" role="treeitem"><a href="/about/quotes/" title="">Quotes</a></li>\n<li class="tier-2 element-3" role="treeitem"><a href="/about/gettingstarted/" title="">Getting Started</a></li>\n<li class="tier-2 element-4" role="treeitem"><a href="/about/help/" title="">Help</a></li>\n<li class="tier-2 element-5" role="treeitem"><a href="http://brochure.getpython.info/" title="">Python Brochure</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>'

And that's the basics. 
I'll probably make some post in the future about how to use this library on a real-world scenario.
