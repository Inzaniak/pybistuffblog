Hello World!
Today we are going to create a simple bar plot in Power Bi.
The first thing we need to do is to add a new Python Data Source.
To do this we have to click on Get Data and the select Python Script.

Let's start coding:
çPython as data source
§python
§import pandas as pd
§from datetime import date, timedelta
§import random
§
§d_list = []
§for i in range(0,10):
§    d_list.append(date.today() - timedelta(days=i))
§
§data_list = []
§curr_temp = 30
§for d in d_list:
§    curr_temp += random.randint(-1,1)
§    data_list.append([d,"Temperature", curr_temp])
§df = pd.DataFrame(data_list, columns = ['Date', 'Metric', 'Temperature'])
With this simple code we create a simple DatFrame with daily Temperature data and assign it to the df object.

çPython as Visualization
With this dataset we can now build our Visualization:
§python
§import seaborn as sns
§import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
§sns.barplot(x="Date",y="Temperature",hue="Metric",data=dataset)
§plt.show()
We are going to use seaborn for this example.
The function we are going to use is <b>.barplot</b>
This function need 3 parameters: 
<b>1.</b> x = The element of the dataframe to use as x axis
<b>2.</b> y = The element of the dataframe to use as x axis
<b>3.</b> hue = The field to choose the color for data categories
<b>4.</b> data = The dataframe containing the data
plt.show() is fundamental to show the graph on Power Bi:

That's all for today.
Next time we are going to take a look at Power Bi Python Visualizations.
