<p><html><body><p>Hello World! I am Umberto Grando, an Italian Business Intelligence junior consultant. I always try to push my passion for computer science and programming to the limit within my work, automating tedious and complicated procedures or testing new software and trends. I work every day on databases and I program mostly in TSQL, Python and VBA.</p>
